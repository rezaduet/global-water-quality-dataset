#A Global Dataset of Surface Water Quality Monitoring Spanning 1940-2023 for Empirical and Machine Learning Research (Submitted to *Scientific Data*)

This repository provides reproducible code for data preprocessing, water quality index calculation, and machine learning applications on a comprehensive global dataset of surface water quality monitoring (1940-2023). These tools aim to facilitate research and enable users to work with water quality data effectively.

The full dataset will be made publicly available upon publication. Meanwhile, a sample subset is provided in this repository for testing code functionality. After publication, all data, files, and code will be shared openly.
